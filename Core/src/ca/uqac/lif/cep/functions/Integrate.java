 * For example, suppose that the processor &pi; is instantiated with the value
 * 0 as its internal object. Let <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> be the function defined
 * as <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i>+1. Then pushing

 * The processor receives <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>, evaluates it on its
 * internal object (0), and returns the result. Pushing <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>
 * once more will produce the output event 2.
