/**
 * By default, a {@link Decimate} acts like a {@link Passthrough} for which only
 * certain inputs are allowed to be output. We call <i>decimation interval</i>
 * the interval between two outputs. The strategy to allow events to be output
 * should be defined in {@link #shouldOutput()}, and an update of the state
 * should be done in {@link #postCompute()}. However, it is possible to
 * completely customize a {@link Decimate} by overriding
 * {@link #processInputs(Object[])} and {@link #postOutput()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Practical examples of {@link Decimate} processors are the
 * {@link CountDecimate}, which outputs the first event of a window of size
 * <i>n</i> and discards all the other, and the {@link TimeDecimate} which
 * outputs an input event and discards all others for the next <i>n</i>
 * nanoseconds.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In case the processor is notified of the end of the trace (EOT, i.e. there is
 * no more event to compute), by default the processor does not output anything,
 * meaning that the last input event will never be processed nor output (except
 * if it matched the decimation interval). Nevertheless, it is possible to
 * specify that you do want to process and output the last input even if it does
 * not match the decimation interval by passing true to
 * {@link #Decimate(boolean)}.
