/**
 * Receives input events and stores them. As its name implies, the
 * {@code Sink} is just that: the end of a pipe of processors where events
 * are input, but which has no output. In other words, a sink is a processor
 * with an output arity of 0.
 * <p>
 * When operating in "pull" mode, it is nevertheless possible to ask the sink to
 * pull on its inputs; this is why, like a {@link Pullable}, it implements
 * methods {@link #pull()} and {@link #pullHard()}.
