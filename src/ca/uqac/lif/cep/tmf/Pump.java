/**
 * Processor that repeatedly pulls its input, and pushes the resulting events to
 * its output. The Pump is a way to bridge an upstream part of a processor chain
 * that works in <em>pull</em> mode, to a downstream part that operates in
 * <em>push</em> mode.
 * <p>
 * Graphically, this processor is represented as:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/tmf/Pump.png" alt="Pump">
 * <p>
 * The repeated pulling of events from its input is started by calling this
 * processor's {@link #start()} method. In the background, this will instantiate
 * a new thread, which will endlessly call {@code pull()} on whatever input is
 * connected to the pump, and then call {@code push()} on whatever input is
 * connected to it.
 * <p>
 * The opposite of the Pump is the {@link ca.uqac.lif.cep.tmf.Tank Tank}.
