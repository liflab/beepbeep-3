/**
 * Elementary classes defining all the basic concepts of event stream
 * processing. Here are some of the important objects defined in this package.
 * 
 * - A {@link ca.uqac.lif.cep.Processor Processor} is an object that takes zero
 * or more event *streams*, and produces zero or more event *streams* as its
 * output. - {@link ca.uqac.lif.cep.Pullable Pullable} and
 * {@link ca.uqac.lif.cep.Pushable Pushable} are two interfaces for receiving
 * and giving events from/to a processor, respectively. -
 * {@link ca.uqac.lif.cep.Connector Connector} provides static methods for
 * easily linking one processor's output to another's input
