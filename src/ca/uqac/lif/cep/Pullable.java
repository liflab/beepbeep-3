/**
 * Queries events on one of a processor's outputs. For a processor with an
 * output arity <i>n</i>, there exists <i>n</i> distinct pullables, namely one for
 * each output pipe. Every pullable works roughly like a classical {@code Iterator}:
 * it is possible to check whether new output events are available, and get one
 * new output event.
 * <p>
 * However, contrarily to iterators, {@code Pullable}s have two versions of each
 * method: a <em>soft</em> and a <em>hard</em> version.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Soft</strong> methods make a single attempt at producing an
 * output event. Since
 * processors are connected in a chain, this generally means pulling events from
 * the input in order to produce the output. However, if pulling the input
 * produces no event, no output event can be produced. In such a case,
 * {@link #hasNextSoft()} will return a special value ({@code MAYBE}), and
 * {@link #pullSoft()} will return {@code null}. Soft methods can be seen a
 * doing "one turn of the crank" on the whole chain of processors --whether or
 * not this outputs something.</li>
 * <li><strong>Hard</strong> methods are actually calls to soft
 * methods until an output event is produced: the "crank" is turned as long as
 * necessary to produce something. This means that one call to, e.g.
 * {@link #pull()} may consume more than one event from a processor's input.
 * Therefore, calls to {@link #hasNext()} never return {@code MAYBE} (only
 * {@code YES} or {@code NO}), and {@link #pull()} throws
 *  {@code NoSuchElementException} only if no event will ever be output in the future (this
 * occurs, for example, when pulling events from a file, and the end of the file
 * has been reached).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of a {@code Pullable} object is as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>One obtains a reference to one of a processor's pullables. This can be done
 * explicitly, e.g. by calling {@link Processor#getPullableOutput(int)}, or
 * implicitly, for example through every call to
 * {@link Connector#connect(Processor...)}.</li>
 * <li>At various moments, one calls
 * {@link #hasNextSoft()} (or {@link #hasNext()} to check if events are
 * available - One calls {@link #pullSoft()} (or {@link #pull()} to produce the
 * next available output event.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The Pullable interface extends the {@code Iterator} and {@code Iterable}
 * interfaces. This means that an instance of {@code Pullable} can also be iterated over like this:
 * <pre>
 * Pullable p = ...; 
 * for (Object o : p) {
 *   // Do something 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note however that if {@code p} refers to a processor producing an
 * infinite number of events, this loop will never terminate by itself.
 * <p>
 * For the same processor, mixing calls to soft and hard methods is discouraged.
 * As a matter of fact, the {@code Pullable}'s behaviour in such a situation is left
 * undefined.
