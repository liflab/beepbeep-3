# This workflow will build a Java project with Ant
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/building-and-testing-java-with-ant

# Same as ant-push.yml, except that no SonarCloud scan is done since pull
# requests do not have access to repository secrets (and thus generate an error
# when attempting to use Sonar).
